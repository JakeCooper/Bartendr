This is why I put this on here...any joker can make punch, but I figured I would distibute my years of fruit research for free....the Best friends you have in the Fruit community are the Orange and the Apple. This is because they absorb the grain better than anything else I tested. So make sure you get some of these in every glass you get, and eat them, DON'T EVER THROW THESE OUT, this is the best part of the drink. Bananas suck, they get gushy, watermellon works ok but the seeds get to be a pain in the ass when you can't see so well, pineapple is good, basically you get the point. Cut the fruit into wedges and throw it in the mix and let it sit around for a minute...Now throw in the bags of ice and fill it up to desired potency with water, mixing can be done with a canoe paddle or a 2x4 or anything else you've got lying around...a disposable camera is usually a good partner while drinking this concoction, people get really outta hand and go off the deep end.....This goes well as an iceblock shot too.",

One made with pasteurized grapefruit juice and old, partially-evaporated ouzo has proven to be an unpleasent experience. Sambuca can be used instead of ouzo, especially if the grapefruit juice used is particularly sour. As far as I know, this drink was invented by James Clippinger and named by Matt Calef.

We found that everyone we brought to our place to party loved this drink, guys and girls equally. I promise this is a great party drink and everyone will love it.

        "comment": "This drink is an adaptation that I learned from a friend in Tacoma, WA. This drink is superior to anything like it because of the fact that using the Absolut Kurant, which is a berry flavored vodka, doesn't kill the flavor of the raspberry taste like a straight vodka does. Also, even though you use Roses lime juice, do not omit the fresh lime. You will definately notice a difference in the taste because the lime juice has sugar in it and it mellows out the sour taste. Enjoy!",

Be careful, it can pack quite a blow, especially if you add more vodka, as suggested. This is a sweet drink, so cheep Andre \"pink\" champagne or any other sparkling wine will do. I would recommend using a good brand of vodka, then potency adjustments are less noticeable. This is a wonderful tasting champagne punch, despite its Kool-Aid roots. One batch is probably good for a party of 5-10 people. Make two batches for medium parties of 10-20 people. (This also maximizes the fact that frozen juice usually comes in 12oz sizes anyway.)",

It is named for his femme fatale - Vesper Lynd - and Bond remarked: \"I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very well-made. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad.\"",

After trying about 15 shots each they started getting sloppy and careless. One of them grabbed the three bottles and mixed them up. He shot it back and the look of pure joy appeared on his face. The other one tried it and this was the beginning of the tastiest shot I've ever had. They came up with this shot and I wanted to share this great shot with all of you.",
